## Cards, Coins and Conquest

This app was created using [`@capacitor/create-app`](https://github.com/ionic-team/create-capacitor-app),
and comes with a very minimal shell for building an app.

### Running this example

To run the provided example, you can use `npm start` command.  You'll need a [client/src/.env](client/src/.env) that holds these lines:

```
VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://*****.supabase.co
VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=*****
VITE_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:5173
VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Ask and I may provide the public and anon keys for my own but since this repo is public I'm not putting the file in.  Also, this project is unfinished so there're some inefficiencies in how assets are loaded.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
